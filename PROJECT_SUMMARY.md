- **Inventory**: Multi-location stock tracking with transactions
- **Orders**: Sales orders, purchase orders, and production orders
- **Forecasting**: Demand planning with multiple algorithms
- **Reporting**: Automated report generation and scheduling

### Key Tables
- `users`, `suppliers`, `customers`
- `products`, `materials`, `boms`, `bom_items`
- `warehouses`, `locations`, `inventory`, `inventory_transactions`
- `sales_orders`, `sales_order_lines`, `purchase_orders`, `purchase_order_lines`
- `production_orders`, `work_centers`, `routings`, `routing_steps`, `production_logs`
- `forecasts`, `consumption_history`, `reorder_policies`
- `system_jobs` (for background job tracking)

## üîß Business Logic

### MRP (Material Requirements Planning)
- **Daily automated runs** at 2:00 AM
- **BOM explosion** for demand calculation
- **Net requirements calculation** considering current inventory, allocated, and on-order
- **Automatic purchase order generation** for materials below reorder point
- **Planned order suggestions** for both materials and finished goods

### Forecasting
- **Simple Moving Average** (SMA-3, SMA-6) algorithms
- **Consumption rate analysis** for demand prediction
- **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)** for forecast accuracy measurement
- **Reorder point recommendations** based on forecast data
- **Confidence level assessment** for forecast reliability

### Production Management
- **Work order lifecycle** from planning to completion
- **Routing-based production** with multiple work centers
- **Capacity utilization tracking** with overload alerts
- **Real-time status updates** and progress tracking
- **Material backflushing** for automatic consumption
